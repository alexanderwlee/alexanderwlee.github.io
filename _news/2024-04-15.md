**{{ date }} {{ page.name }}:** I committed to [Brown University]({{ links.brown
}}) for my PhD in computer science! Thank you to all my professors, friends, and
family who supported me during this application process. I am so excited to
start in the Fall as a member of the [Brown Database Group]({{ links.brown_db
}}), led by [Ugur Cetintemel]({{ links.ugur }}).
