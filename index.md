{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I am an incoming **computer science PhD student** at [Brown University]({{
links.brown }}), where I will be advised by [Ugur Cetintemel]({{ links.ugur }})
and supported in part by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]({{ links.nsf }}).
My research interests are in databases and machine learning.

I graduated from [Amherst College]({{ links.amherst }}) with a Bachelor of Arts
in [computer science]({{ links.amherst_cs }}) and [mathematics]({{
links.amherst_math }}). At Amherst, I researched scalable and
statistically-sound data mining algorithms as a member of the [Data*
Mammoths]({{ links.acdmammoths }}) research and learning group led by [Matteo
Riondato]({{ links.matteo }}).

I am also a **software engineer** at [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }}) on the
Commerce Catalog team in Cloud + AI.

As for hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis, ice hockey, guitar, and cello.
