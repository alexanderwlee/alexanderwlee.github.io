{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I am a **software engineer** at [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }}). I graduated
**_summa cum laude_** from [Amherst College]({{ links.amherst }}) with a
Bachelor of Arts in [computer science]({{ links.amherst_cs }}) and
[mathematics]({{ links.amherst_math }}) and received the **Computer Science
Prize**. At Amherst, I was involved in the [Amherst College Data* Mammoths]({{
links.acdmammoths }}) research and learning group, where I worked as a
**research assistant** under the leadership of [Matteo Riondato]({{ links.matteo
}}). Prior to research, I worked for the [Department of Computer Science]({{
links.amherst_cs }}) as both a **teaching assistant** and **peer tutor** for
multiple computer science courses. I was the **president** of the Amherst
College Computer Science Club.

Outside of academics, I have held leadership positions in Amherst's Asian
Students Association as Co-Chair of the Asian Men's Collective and as Treasurer
of the Chinese Students Association. As for hobbies, I grew up playing ice
hockey, tennis, rugby, cello, and guitar!
