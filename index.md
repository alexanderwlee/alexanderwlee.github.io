{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I am a **software engineer** at [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }}) on the
Commerce Catalog team in Cloud + AI. I graduated from [Amherst College]({{
links.amherst }}) with a Bachelor of Arts in [computer science]({{
links.amherst_cs }}) and [mathematics]({{ links.amherst_math }}). At Amherst, I
was an **undergraduate researcher** in the [Data* Mammoths]({{ links.acdmammoths
}}) research and learning group led by [Matteo Riondato]({{ links.matteo }}). My
research interests are in databases, knowledge discovery, data mining, and
machine learning.
