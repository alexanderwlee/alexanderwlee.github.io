{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I am a **PhD student** in [computer science]({{ links.brown_cs }}) at [Brown
University]({{ links.brown }}), advised by [Uğur Çetintemel]({{ links.ugur }})
and supported in part by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]({{ links.nsf }}).
I am broadly interested in the intersection of **databases** and **AI**, with a
current focus on enhancing trust in AI-augmented data systems via integrity
constraints (a.k.a. guardrails).

I graduated from [Amherst College]({{ links.amherst }}) with a Bachelor of Arts
in [computer science]({{ links.amherst_cs }}) and [mathematics]({{
links.amherst_math }}). At Amherst, I explored scalable and statistically-sound
data mining algorithms as a research assistant in the [Data* Mammoths]({{
links.acdmammoths }}) research and learning group led by [Matteo Riondato]({{
links.matteo }}).

Between my time at Amherst and Brown, I worked as a software engineer at
[Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }}) in Redmond, WA.

As for hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis, ice hockey, guitar, and cello!
