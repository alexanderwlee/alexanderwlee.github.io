{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I am a **software engineer** at [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }}) on the
Commerce Catalog team in Cloud + AI. I graduated from [Amherst College]({{
links.amherst }}) with a Bachelor of Arts in [computer science]({{
links.amherst_cs }}) and [mathematics]({{ links.amherst_math }}). At Amherst, I
worked as an **undergraduate researcher** in the [Amherst College Data*
Mammoths]({{ links.acdmammoths }}) research and learning group led by [Matteo
Riondato]({{ links.matteo }}). My research interest is in knowledge discovery,
data mining, machine learning, and databases.
