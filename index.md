# About Me

I am a **software engineer** at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). I
graduated **_summa cum laude_** from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/)
with a Bachelor of Arts in [computer
science](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer_science) and
[mathematics](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics)
and received the **Computer Science Prize**. At Amherst, I was involved in the
[Amherst College Data* Mammoths](https://acdmammoths.github.io/) research and
learning group, where I worked as a **research assistant** under the leadership
of [Matteo Riondato](https://matteo.rionda.to/). Prior to research, I worked for
the Department of Computer Science as both a **teaching assistant** and **peer
tutor** for multiple computer science courses. I was the **president** of the
Amherst College Computer Science Club.

Outside of academics, I have held leadership positions in Amherst's Asian
Students Association as Co-Chair of the Asian Men's Collective and as Treasurer
of the Chinese Students Association. As for hobbies, I grew up playing ice
hockey, tennis, rugby, cello, and guitar!
