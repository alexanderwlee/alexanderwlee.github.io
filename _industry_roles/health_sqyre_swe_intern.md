{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I developed [Flask]({{ links.flask }}) microservices for the startup's medical
devices e-commerce platform. I focused on refining the algorithm for retrieving
patient medical insurance data in the insurance payment microservice.
Furthermore, I enhanced building and testing efficiency among engineers by
developing Flask web applications for querying company-utilized APIs.
