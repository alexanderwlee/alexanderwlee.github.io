{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I worked with a team of engineers to develop [Flask]({{ links.flask }})
microservices for the startup company's medical devices e-commerce platform. I
primarily focused on refining the algorithm for retrieving patient medical
insurance data for the company's insurance payment microservice. Furthermore, I
enhanced building and testing efficiency among engineers by developing Flask web
applications for querying company utilized APIs.
