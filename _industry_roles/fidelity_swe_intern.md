{% assign links = site.data.links %}

I interned with the Contact Center Cloud Solutions team and implemented software
solutions for [Fidelity]({{ links.fidelity }}) contact centers using [AWS]({{
links.aws }}). My projects boosted the productivity of branch agents and
improved customer call experience by leveraging services such as Amazon
[Connect]({{ links.aws_connect }}), [Lambda]({{ links.aws_lambda }}), [Lex]({{
links.aws_lex }}), [DynamoDB]({{ links.aws_dynamodb }}), and [Elasticsearch]({{
links.aws_elasticsearch }}) to route customers to the appropriate contact
centers.
