I work on [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }})'s Cloud + AI Commerce Catalog
Frontdoor team. Responsible for 90% of Microsoft's revenue, our services are
core to the company's commerce stack, powering storefronts such as [Azure]({{
links.azure }}), [Microsoft 365]({{ links.m365 }}), [Xbox]({{ links.xbox }}),
and [Windows]({{ links.windows }}). Scaling to over 200K requests per second and
serving more than 200 downstream services, our services are the back-end that
enables product browse, discovery, pricing, purchase, and post-purchase
scenarios.

My most notable project is a feature that helps Azure Marketplaceâ€™s independent
service vendors (e.g., Red Hat, Citrix, Couchbase) and Azure customers transact
on [private offers]({{ links.azure_private_offers }}) with time-bound pricing
and customized terms. Each of these private offers is worth millions of dollars.
My responsibilities for the project ranged from working with multiple teams on
the design to coding and helping downstream services with API integration.
