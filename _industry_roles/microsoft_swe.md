I worked on [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }})'s Cloud + AI Commerce Catalog
Frontdoor team. Sitting at the foundation of Microsoft's commerce stack, our
services ingest and serve all the company's product data, enabling critical
functionalities (e.g., browse, purchase, renew) for major storefronts (e.g.,
[Azure]({{ links.azure }}), [Xbox]({{ links.xbox }}), [Office]({{ links.office}} )). Catalog handles 90% of the company's revenue, scales to
over 200K requests per second, and supports over 200 downstream services.
