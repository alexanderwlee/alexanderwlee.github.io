I work on [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }})'s Cloud + AI Commerce Catalog
Frontdoor team. Responsible for 90% of Microsoft's revenue, our services are
core to the company's commerce stack, powering storefronts such as [Azure]({{
links.azure }}), [Microsoft 365]({{ links.m365 }}), [Xbox]({{ links.xbox }}),
and [Windows]({{ links.windows }}). Scaling to over 200K requests per second and
