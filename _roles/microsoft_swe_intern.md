title: Software Engineer Intern
period: Summer 2021

I interned on the Frontdoor team for Microsoft's Commerce Catalog group. The
team owns an ASP.NET API service that scales over 150,000 request per second and
powers the Microsoft Commerce stack for services such as Azure, Windows, Office,
and Xbox. My intern project focused on enhancing the on-call experience for
engineers by developing features on the team's service to diagnose product
configuration issues.
