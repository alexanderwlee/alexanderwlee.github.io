I interned with the Contact Center Cloud Solutions team and implemented software
solutions for Fidelity contact centers using AWS. My projects boosted the
productivity of branch agents and improved customer call experience by
leveraging services such as Amazon Connect, Lambda, Lex, DynamoDB, and
Elasticsearch to route customers to the appropriate contact centers.
