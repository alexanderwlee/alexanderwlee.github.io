I work on Microsoft's Cloud + AI Commerce Catalog Frontdoor team. Responsible
for 90% of Microsoft's revenue, our services are core to Microsoft's commerce
stack, powering storefronts such as Azure, Microsoft 365, Xbox, and Windows. We
enable product browse, discovery, purchase, and post-purchase scenarios. Scaling
over 200K RPS, we serve more than 200 partners and run on the largest Kubernetes
clusters with over 1500 virtual machines across multiple regions and clouds.
