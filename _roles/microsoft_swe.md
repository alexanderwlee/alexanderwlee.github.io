I work on [Microsoft]({{ links.microsoft }})'s Cloud + AI Commerce Catalog
Frontdoor team. Responsible for 90% of Microsoft's revenue, our services are
core to Microsoft's commerce stack, powering storefronts such as [Azure]({{
links.azure }}), [Microsoft 365]({{ links.m365 }}), [Xbox]({{ links.xbox }}),
and [Windows]({{ links.windows }}). We enable product browse, discovery,
purchase, and post-purchase scenarios. Scaling over 200K RPS, we serve more than
200 partners and run on the largest [Azure Kubernetes]({{ links.aks }}) clusters
with over 1500 virtual machines across multiple regions and clouds.
