I conducted research as a member of the [Amherst College Data*
Mammoths](https://acdmammoths.github.io/), led by [Matteo
Riondato](https://matteo.rionda.to/). The research in which I was involved
improved the scalability for balanced sampling by developing a [parallel
algorithm for the cube
method](https://github.com/acdmammoths/parallelcubesampling). Our work was
accepted for publication as a [student abstract/poster to
AAAI-22](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/student-abstract-and-poster-program/).
