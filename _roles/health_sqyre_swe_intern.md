I worked with a team of engineers to develop Flask microservices for the startup
company's medical devices e-commerce platform. I primarily focused on increasing
the accuracy of parsing patient medical insurance data for the company's
insurance payment microservice. Furthermore, I enhanced building and testing
efficiency among engineers by developing Flask web applications for querying
company utilized APIs.
